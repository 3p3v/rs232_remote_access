# RS-232 remote access - Client application
This branch contains client application part of the project.

The application is the main interface through which users can connect to and use the devices.
The application allows users to send and download data from/to the device and to remotely change the device's console port settings. 
When the application is launched, it connects to a user-selected console port available locally on the device.

## Libraries
The application was written using C++17 and utilizes the following libraries:
- STL,
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) - version 1.83 was used,
- [Boost.Asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) - used for asynchronous serial port operations (version 1.83 was used),
- [Eclipse Paho MQTT C++ Client Library](https://github.com/3p3v/paho.mqtt.cpp.unique) - fork of Paho MQTT C++ library (1.20), which uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers. [Eclipse Paho MQTT C Client Library](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c) is needed to run the library. Version 1.3.13 was used.

Tests were written using GTest framework.

## Project structure
The main functions can be found in [app](./app/) for final app and [app_debug](./app_debug/) - for debug purposes.

The rest of the files are located in [libs](./libs/) directory:
- [core](./libs/core/) contains files that implement the connections between user and the remote device (in respect to the remotes protocol),
- [main_modules](./libs/main_modules/) implements the management of the devices, error handling ect.,
- [setup_loader](./libs/setup_loader/) implements loading structures from setup file.

Core and main_modules were split into *_agn and *_impl.
Classes in *_agn are implementation-agnostic and thanks to that they have been unit-tested.
Classes in *_impl depend on the low-level implementation of the device (i.e. Boost.Asio and Paho).

## Building the project
To build the project, the libraries specified above are needed.
It is required to set correct paths to them in the [main CMakeLists.txt file](./CMakeLists.txt).

## Config file
While starting the app, user is obligated to pass a path to config file using "-conf" parmaeter.

The config file commands are listed below:
